                    <p>Just a few steps away from Baisley Park Houses’ vacant community center, 14-year-old Aamir Griffin was gunned down on the park’s basketball court.</p>
                    <p>His death in October sent shockwaves through the community, where residents and leaders immediately called for more indoor safe havens. As a result, the Baisley Park Houses Community Center will reopen this January for the first time since 2008.</p>
                    <p>The opening of the center comes as violence has almost doubled in the community since 2018.</p>
                    <p>According to the 113th precinct’s Nov. 24 <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs-en-us-113pct.pdf">crime statistics report</a>, year-to-date murder cases are up 140% in 2019 with 12 reported cases thus far. There have been 31 shooting victims and 24 shooting incidents this year, up 94% and 85%, respectively, from 2018.</p>
                    <p>“What we’re seeing is gang violence. Six of our recent shootings have been gang-related—gang-crew related,” said Inspector Brian Bohannon. “Since July 12, we actually had 15 shooting incidents.”</p>
                    <p>Officials hope indoor centers can give youths additional alternatives and keep them off the street, especially during night hours.</p>
                    <p>“There is a need and a need for them to be effective,” said Queens Community Board 12 District Manager Yvonne Reddick.</p>
                    <p>On the Baisley Park court, a memorial has been set up for Griffin. The teenager’s basketball jerseys hung above a line of candles shaped in a heart.</p>
                    <p>His tragic death sparked a collaboration between the 113th Precinct and Council Members Adrienne Adams (D-Queens) and I. Daneek Miller (D-Queens) to reopen the center.</p>
                    <p>Adams hosted a town-hall meeting in South Jamaica with Mayor Bill de Blasio on Nov. 14, where the mayor announced that the city would provide $5 million in renovations to the community center.</p>
                    <p>The center is connected to the Baisley Park housing complex, funded by the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA). But it’s not just for NYCHA residents.</p>
                    <p>“From our knowledge, speaking with people who are closely related to the situation in Baisley Houses, it will be opened to all of the community, so all ages,” said Kristen Holness, constituent liaison for New York State Senator James Sanders.</p>
                    <p>NYCHA originally funded Baisley Park’s Community Center for 20 years, but after losing $611 million in federal aid from 2001-08, the agency was forced to close the center’s doors, <a href="https://qns.com/story/2008/03/25/baisley-park-community-center-to-close/">QNS reported</a>.</p>
                    <p>Whether the housing authority will again help fund the program is still unclear, as NYCHA representatives could not be reached for comment.</p>
                    <p>The Baisley Park center will be only the 13th facility in Queens that is on NYCHA property, according to <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Directory-of-NYCHA-Community-Facilities/crns-fw6u/data">NYC Open Data’s Directory of NYCHA Community Facilities</a>.</p>
                    <p>In comparison, Brooklyn has 43 centers, Manhattan 37, Bronx 29 and Staten Island 7, according to the same data.</p>
                    <p>When asked whether the community could expect more centers and shelters for youths, Reddick responded, “We shall see.”</p>
